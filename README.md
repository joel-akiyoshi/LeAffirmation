# LeAffirmation: LeBron-Style Personal Hype Man

**LeAffirmation** is a voice-activated mood detection system that plays motivational or humorous LeBron James audio clips based on how you're feeling. Built using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Vosk for speech recognition, and VADER for sentiment analysis, this project brings together hardware and AI to deliver hype exactly when you need it.

We created this project for fun and to challenge ourselves in a creative way — plus, we're big fans of basketball and LeBron memes. Whether you're feeling down, neutral, hyped, or in full meme mode, LeAffirmation has something to say.
